The lightning rail is the house&rsquo;s most dramatic tool, but Orien also runs caravans and coaches across the length of Khorvaire. Dragonshard focus items ensure that the fastest vehicles are those driven by heirs with the Mark of Passage, but the house also licenses unmarked teamsters. The Courier&rsquo;s Guild of House Orien delivers mail and packages and has a branch that handles more covert and dangerous deliveries.</p>\r\n<p>Orien has dominated transportation for centuries, but now the house is facing challenges. The Mournland is a dramatic obstacle for ground transportation, and Baron Kwanti d&rsquo;Orien has had tremendous difficulty securing funds to rebuild the lightning rail line across the blasted landscape. Indeed, he spends most of his time away from his headquarters in Aundair, trying to raise funds for the project while keeping an eye on house operations. He travels across western Khorvaire in his personal lightning rail coach, the Silver Unicorn&mdash;a reference to the house&rsquo;s unicorn emblem.</p>\r\n<p>House Orien&rsquo;s problems don&rsquo;t end with the Mournland, though. The expanding role of Lyrandar airships threatens the house&rsquo;s business. Baron Kwanti would like to be able to offer more instantaneous transportation, but long-distance teleportation is a service only the strongest Orien dragonmarks can provide. So the house is working with House Cannith in an effort to unlock and enhance this gift of the Mark of Passage. Orien heirs might be caught up in these experiments or in the rivalry with House Lyrandar.</p>\n\n<p><b>Languages</b></p>\n<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

But these exotic creatures aren&rsquo;t enough to satisfy the most innovative members of the house, leading to the practice of magebreeding. Using dragonshard focus items, Vadalis has found ways to create magical creatures. Typically, this results in a superior version of a creature&mdash;an animal that is stronger, faster, and smarter.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves rose up against the giants who ruled that land. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen&rsquo;drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal. There they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal.

Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving.

The greatest heroes of your people join the Undying Court after death; if you achieve great things in your life, you too could achieve this immortality.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island.

The house also trains and licenses scribes, notaries, interpreters, cartographers, barristers, heralds, bookbinders, and others who work with words.

Most people give little thought to House Ghallanda; when compared to the soldiers of House Deneith and the factories of House Cannith, an alliance of innkeepers seems harmless and inconsequential. But Ghallanda&rsquo;s strength lies in charm and connections. A Ghallanda innkeeper hears many things&mdash;if you want to know what&rsquo;s really going on in a community, talk to the halfling bartender. The leaders of House Ghallanda don&rsquo;t sell information; they prefer to build friendship and deal in favors. But should a Ghallanda baron ever truly need something, they likely have a favor they can call in.</p>\r\n<p>Ghallanda has a number of &ldquo;bound businesses&rdquo;&mdash;franchises run directly by the house. The Gold Dragon Inn is such a business, with Gold Dragon Inns being found in every major city, each serving a familiar menu and providing similar services. But many Ghallanda heirs take pride in creating their own unique businesses. There are also many independent restaurants, inns, and taverns licensed by House Ghallanda.

When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin&rsquo;s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The following tables offer personality suggestions for eladrin of each season.

The chain wrapped around Caerys&rsquo; blade but she twisted away. The flail flew into the darkness. She spun forward, her double blade weaving a circle of fire as she danced toward the chieftain. In a moment the song of steel was over.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">Caerys watched as the warlord fell to the ground.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves rose up against the giants who ruled that land. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen&rsquo;drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal. There they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. While neither of these cultures have much interest in human activities, a small number of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the years and have integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. As an elf, consider your relationship with the past. Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way forward?</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"ElvesofValenar\" class=\"Header-2\">Elves of Valenar</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Your people are dedicated to the arts of war. Millenia ago, your ancestors fought an epic war against mighty giants. When they came to Khorvaire, they battled the champions of the goblin empire. The greatest heroes of those struggles live on after death, known as the&nbsp;<span class=\"Emphasis\">patron ancestors</span>. When you became an adult, one of the patron ancestors formed a bond with you. Now it is your duty to follow in the footsteps of your patron, living your life as they lived theirs, allowing this champion to live on through you. This is why your people constantly seek out conflict; you need to find challenges worthy of a hero.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">In creating a Valenar, think about your patron ancestor. Your class should reflect their class; if you&rsquo;re a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. If you&rsquo;re a ranger, was your ancestor a famous blademaster, or a stealthy hunter? Was your ancestor chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their nature, it&rsquo;s your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Each patron ancestor is tied to many Valenar: do you have a particular rival who channels the same ancestor, or one who channels a rival of your ancestor?</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">It&rsquo;s also important to think about why you are traveling with a group of player characters instead of serving in a Valenar warband. Are you driven by visions from your patron ancestor? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors their legendary deeds? Do you seek vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?</p>\n\n<p><b>Darkvision</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-racial-traits.i8nm2hY9ap7ZoLa9]{Darkvision}</p>\n<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

She smiled behind her spirit veil, counting the blades arrayed against her.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">&ldquo;But forty will.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Elven culture began on the distant continent of Xen&rsquo;drik. Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves rose up against the giants who ruled that land. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen&rsquo;drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal. There they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. While neither of these cultures have much interest in human activities, a small number of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the years and have integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. As an elf, consider your relationship with the past. Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way forward?</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"ElvesofAerenal\" class=\"Header-2\">Elves of Aerenal</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Aerenal is ruled by the Undying Court, a council of undead elves sustained by positive energy. The Undying Court wields godlike power and has protected your island home for thousands of years. The greatest heroes of your people join the Undying Court after death; if you achieve great things in your life, you too could achieve this immortality.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war. With this in mind, what has caused you to leave your island and wander the world? Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against the Undying Court?</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As one of the Aereni, think about your history. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what&rsquo;s your relationship with them? Do you find dealing with the short-lived races to be a challenge, or are you patient with them?</p>\n\n<p><b>Darkvision</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-racial-traits.i8nm2hY9ap7ZoLa9]{Darkvision}</p>\n<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

Ten thousand years ago Daealyth of Taeri stood this ground and faced your ancestors, and twenty fell before his singing blades. You are no Dhakaani of old, and a mere twenty of you will bring no honor to the Taeri.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">The warlord hissed in fury, and his flail flashed in the firelight. The chain wrapped around Caerys&rsquo; blade but she twisted away. The flail flew into the darkness. She spun forward, her double blade weaving a circle of fire as she danced toward the chieftain. In a moment the song of steel was over.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">Caerys watched as the warlord fell to the ground. With a contemptuous snap of her wrist, she flicked the blood from her blade into the eyes of the stunned onlookers. She smiled behind her spirit veil, counting the blades arrayed against her.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">&ldquo;But forty will.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Elven culture began on the distant continent of Xen&rsquo;drik. Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves rose up against the giants who ruled that land. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen&rsquo;drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal. There they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. While neither of these cultures have much interest in human activities, a small number of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the years and have integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. As an elf, consider your relationship with the past. Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way forward?</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"ElvesofValenar\" class=\"Header-2\">Elves of Valenar</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Your people are dedicated to the arts of war. Millenia ago, your ancestors fought an epic war against mighty giants. When they came to Khorvaire, they battled the champions of the goblin empire. The greatest heroes of those struggles live on after death, known as the&nbsp;<span class=\"Emphasis\">patron ancestors</span>. When you became an adult, one of the patron ancestors formed a bond with you. Now it is your duty to follow in the footsteps of your patron, living your life as they lived theirs, allowing this champion to live on through you. This is why your people constantly seek out conflict; you need to find challenges worthy of a hero.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">In creating a Valenar, think about your patron ancestor. Your class should reflect their class; if you&rsquo;re a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. If you&rsquo;re a ranger, was your ancestor a famous blademaster, or a stealthy hunter? Was your ancestor chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their nature, it&rsquo;s your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Each patron ancestor is tied to many Valenar: do you have a particular rival who channels the same ancestor, or one who channels a rival of your ancestor?</p>\r\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">It&rsquo;s also important to think about why you are traveling with a group of player characters instead of serving in a Valenar warband. Are you driven by visions from your patron ancestor? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors their legendary deeds? Do you seek vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?</p>\n\n<p><b>Darkvision</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-racial-traits.i8nm2hY9ap7ZoLa9]{Darkvision}</p>\n<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
